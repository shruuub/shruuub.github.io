Hey! Nice you got here:D I just made this video to show 
<a href= "https://github.com/shruuub" >my Github</a> Projects

<p>1 Project:</p>
<p>Super easy Password generator which does his Job, but not more.</p>
<p>- Not customisable, just completely random. </p>
<p>- The passworts are between 8 and 16 characters.</p>
<p>- The passwort should be directly printed and should also be printed to a file called output.txt. </p>
<p>- you need python installed for this to work. </p>

<a href= "https://github.com/shruuub" >my Github</a> Projects

1 Project:
Super easy Password generator which does his Job, but not more.
- Not customisable, just completely random
- The passworts are between 8 and 16 characters.
- The passwort should be directly printed and should also be printed to a file called output.txt
- you need python installed for this to work.
